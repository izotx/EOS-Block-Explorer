# EOS Block Explorer

User Story:
========
```
As an EOS User I want to see the contents of the most recent blocks on the public
blockchain.

```

Developer Notes
=========

- Blockchain related operations can be found in the Blockchain.swift file 
- Unit tests that cover mostly JSON parsing can be found in: EOSBlockExplorerTests.swift


Given more time I would implement several things differently:
1. I would chain networking operations using RxSwift or PromiseKit
2. Core Data and fetch view controller for displaying 
3. Sync with blockchain beyond 20 blocks, while also updating the newest block
